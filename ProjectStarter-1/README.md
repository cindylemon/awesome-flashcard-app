# My Personal Project
## Cindy's Super Awesome Flashcards

I've tried **alot** of flashcard apps this year, but I haven't been able to find one that I really like.
The ones that I've tried so far at least, all suck. None of them had the simplicity, aesthetic, and 
*free-ness* that I was looking for. I've decided to take matters into my own hands and make my own flashcard
application! I hope that my fellow students and I can use this over the overly complex or money-grabbing apps.

Planned implementations:
- photos within the flashcards
- different sets and subjects
- different themes (dark mode/light mode)
- I really want it to look nice

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to make new question + answer flashcards
- As a user, I want to be able to add different cards into different sets or subjects (lists)
- As a user, I want to be able to view my different sets
- As a user, I also want to be able to view the different cards within the sets
- As a user, I want to be able to choose to save the current state of my flashcards.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose to load my previous state of flashcards from file.

# Instructions for End User
- You can generate the first required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by adding multiple sets to the application AND being able to add different cards to each set.
- You can generate the second required action related to the user story "adding multiple Xs to a Y" by going through each flashcard (flipping, next, previous) and being able to delete them.
- You can locate my visual component by saving or loading data from the json
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load button
